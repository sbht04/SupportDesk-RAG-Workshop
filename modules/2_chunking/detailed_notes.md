### Connecting to Module 1

> **Opening Line:** "We just covered Embeddings and Vector Stores... but there's a missing piece!"

**Diagram to Draw:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Embeddings       │ ── We just covered this
├─────────────────────┤
│    Vector Store     │ ── We just covered this
├─────────────────────┤
│    Chunking         │ ── What is this though? 🤔
└─────────────────────┘
```

**The Problem to Pose:**
- What happens when your document is 10,000 tokens but embedding models only accept 8,191?
- What happens when your PDF is 50 pages?
- What happens when you have a complete user manual?

> **Key Question to Ask:** "How do we break these down into pieces suitable for embedding?"

## 2. Why Chunking Matters

### The Core Challenge

| Constraint | Limit | Problem If Ignored |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| Embedding API limit | 8,191 tokens | API error / truncation |
| LLM context window | 4K-128K tokens | Can't fit retrieved docs |
| Retrieval precision | Depends on query | Too much irrelevant content |

### The Goldilocks Problem

```
Too Small (10 tokens):
"password reset" 
→ No context, noisy, matches everything

Too Large (5000 tokens):
"[Entire support manual with 50 topics]"
→ Diluted embedding, irrelevant info returned

Just Right (200-500 tokens):
"To reset your password: 1) Go to login page 2) Click 'Forgot Password'
3) Enter email 4) Check inbox for reset link 5) Create new password
that meets requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number"
→ Complete, focused, retrieves accurately
```

**Teaching Point:** Chunking is about finding the OPTIMAL size for your use case!

### Strategy 1: Fixed-Size Chunking

**What It Is:** Split text into uniform segments based on a pre-defined number of characters, words, or tokens.

**Visual (from slide):**
```
"Artificial intelligence is transforming technology and shaping the future."
  └──────────── Chunk 1 ──────────────┘└── Overlap ──┘
                                       └──────────── Chunk 2 ──────────────┘
```

**Key Concept: OVERLAP**
```python
# Without overlap: Information at boundaries is LOST
Chunk 1: "The quick brown fox jumps"
Chunk 2: "over the lazy dog."
# Query "fox jumps over" might not match well!

# With overlap: Boundary information is PRESERVED
Chunk 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over"
Chunk 2: "fox jumps over the lazy dog."
# Query "fox jumps over" now matches both!
```

**Code Example:**
```python
def fixed_size_chunking(text, chunk_size=500, overlap=100):
    """Split text into fixed-size chunks with overlap."""
    chunks = []
    start = 0
    
    while start < len(text):
        end = start + chunk_size
        chunk = text[start:end]
        chunks.append(chunk)
        start = end - overlap  # Move back by overlap amount
    
    return chunks

# Example
text = "A" * 1000  # 1000 characters
chunks = fixed_size_chunking(text, chunk_size=300, overlap=50)
# Result: 4 chunks
# Chunk 1: chars 0-300
# Chunk 2: chars 250-550 (overlaps 250-300)
# Chunk 3: chars 500-800 (overlaps 500-550)
# Chunk 4: chars 750-1000 (overlaps 750-800)
```

**Using LangChain:**
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    separator="\n"
)
chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple to implement | May split mid-sentence |
| Predictable sizes | Ignores document structure |
| Fast processing | Can break semantic units |
| Easy to understand | No content awareness |

**Best For:** 
- Quick prototypes
- Unstructured text (chat logs, transcripts)
- When you need predictable sizes

**Parameters to Tune:**
| Parameter | Typical Range | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| chunk_size | 200-1000 | Start with 300-500 |
| overlap | 10-25% of size | 50-100 tokens |

### Strategy 2: Semantic Chunking

**What It Is:** Segment based on **meaning** using embeddings to detect topic shifts.

**The Algorithm (from slide):**
```
Document ──► Segment into sentences/paragraphs
                    │
                    ▼
        Initial first chunk ──► Keep adding segments
                                       │
                    ┌──────────────────┤
                    │                  ▼
                    │      Check cosine similarity with current chunk
                    │                  │
                    │     ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                    │     │                         │
                    │  Similarity HIGH          Similarity DROPS
                    │  (same topic)             (topic changed!)
                    │     │                         │
                    │     ▼                         ▼
                    │  Add to current chunk    Start NEW chunk
                    │                               │
                    └───────────────────────────────┘
                                    │
                                    ▼
                              Final chunks
```

**Visual Example (from slide):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Artificial intelligence is transforming industries by automating            │
│ processes, enhancing decision-making, and providing insights through       │
│ data analysis.                                                              │ ← Chunk 1 (AI/automation topic)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn                  │
│ and improve from experience without explicit programming.                   │ ← Chunk 2 (ML topic)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, uses neural networks          │
│ with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.                    │ ← Chunk 3 (DL topic)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Code Example:**
```python
from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

semantic_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    breakpoint_threshold_type="percentile",  # Options: percentile, standard_deviation, interquartile
    breakpoint_threshold_amount=95  # Break when similarity drops below 95th percentile
)

chunks = semantic_splitter.split_text(text)
```

**How It Decides Where to Split:**
```python
# Simplified algorithm
def semantic_chunking(text, threshold=0.7):
    sentences = split_sentences(text)
    embeddings = [get_embedding(s) for s in sentences]
    
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = [sentences[0]]
    
    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        # Compare consecutive sentences
        similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[i-1], embeddings[i])
        
        if similarity >= threshold:
            # Same topic - keep adding
            current_chunk.append(sentences[i])
        else:
            # Topic changed - start new chunk
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sentences[i]]
    
    chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
    return chunks
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Preserves semantic coherence | Expensive (needs embeddings) |
| Natural topic boundaries | Variable chunk sizes |
| Adapts to content | Slower processing |
| Best retrieval quality | More complex to implement |

**Best For:**
- High-value content where accuracy matters
- Articles, research papers
- When you need topic-based retrieval

### Semantic Chunking Deep Dive: Edge Cases & Solutions

> **Teaching Point:** Students often ask "What about...?" These are the real-world edge cases that make semantic chunking tricky.

#### Step-by-Step Example: How Semantic Chunking Works

```
Document: "AI is transforming healthcare. Machine learning diagnoses diseases. 
           The stock market crashed yesterday. Investors are worried."
```

**Step 1: Split into sentences**
```
Sentence 1: "AI is transforming healthcare."
Sentence 2: "Machine learning diagnoses diseases."
Sentence 3: "The stock market crashed yesterday."
Sentence 4: "Investors are worried."
```

**Step 2: Get embedding for each sentence**
```
Sentence 1 → [0.8, 0.2, 0.1, ...]   (AI/healthcare topic)
Sentence 2 → [0.75, 0.25, 0.15, ...] (AI/healthcare topic - SIMILAR!)
Sentence 3 → [0.1, 0.9, 0.3, ...]   (finance topic - DIFFERENT!)
Sentence 4 → [0.15, 0.85, 0.25, ...] (finance topic - similar to 3)
```

**Step 3: Compare consecutive sentences using cosine similarity**
```
Similarity(Sent1, Sent2) = 0.95  ← HIGH! Same topic, keep together
Similarity(Sent2, Sent3) = 0.20  ← LOW! Topic changed, SPLIT HERE!
Similarity(Sent3, Sent4) = 0.92  ← HIGH! Same topic, keep together
```

**Step 4: Create chunks based on similarity drops**
```
Chunk 1: "AI is transforming healthcare. Machine learning diagnoses diseases."
         (Both about AI/healthcare)

Chunk 2: "The stock market crashed yesterday. Investors are worried."
         (Both about finance)
```

**Visual Diagram:**
```
                    Cosine Similarity Between Consecutive Sentences
                    
Sentence:    1         2         3         4
             │         │         │         │
             ▼         ▼         ▼         ▼
            [AI]─────[ML]      [Stock]───[Investors]
                  │                   │
           sim=0.95              sim=0.92
           (same topic)          (same topic)
                  │                   │
                  └────────┬──────────┘
                           │
                     sim=0.20 ← SPLIT HERE!
                    (topic changed)

Result:
┌──────────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────┐
│        CHUNK 1           │    │        CHUNK 2           │
│ AI is transforming...    │    │ The stock market...      │
│ Machine learning...      │    │ Investors are worried.   │
└──────────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────────┘
     (AI/Healthcare)                   (Finance)
```

---

#### Edge Case 1: Similar Sentences NOT Together

**The Problem:**
```
Sentence 1: "AI transforms healthcare."           (AI topic)
Sentence 2: "The stock market crashed."           (Finance topic)
Sentence 3: "Machine learning diagnoses diseases." (AI topic - but separated!)
Sentence 4: "Investors are panicking."            (Finance topic)
```

**What Basic Semantic Chunking Does:**
```
Compare 1→2: similarity = 0.2  → SPLIT
Compare 2→3: similarity = 0.15 → SPLIT  
Compare 3→4: similarity = 0.2  → SPLIT

Result: 4 separate chunks! 😞
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│ AI transforms   │ │ Stock market    │ │ ML diagnoses    │ │ Investors are   │
│ healthcare.     │ │ crashed.        │ │ diseases.       │ │ panicking.      │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘

The two AI sentences are in SEPARATE chunks!
```

**Why This Happens:** Basic semantic chunking only compares CONSECUTIVE sentences - it can't "see" that sentences 1 and 3 are related.

**Solution A: Sliding Window Comparison**
```python
def semantic_chunking_with_window(sentences, window_size=3, threshold=0.7):
    embeddings = [get_embedding(s) for s in sentences]
    
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = [sentences[0]]
    
    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        # Compare new sentence to AVERAGE of current chunk (not just previous)
        chunk_embeddings = [embeddings[j] for j in range(len(current_chunk))]
        chunk_avg_embedding = np.mean(chunk_embeddings, axis=0)
        similarity = cosine_similarity(chunk_avg_embedding, embeddings[i])
        
        if similarity >= threshold:
            current_chunk.append(sentences[i])
        else:
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sentences[i]]
    
    return chunks
```

**Solution B: Clustering Approach**
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def cluster_based_chunking(sentences, n_clusters=5):
    embeddings = [get_embedding(s) for s in sentences]
    
    # Cluster by meaning (groups similar sentences regardless of position)
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)
    
    # Group sentences by cluster
    chunks = {}
    for i, label in enumerate(labels):
        if label not in chunks:
            chunks[label] = []
        chunks[label].append(sentences[i])
    
    return list(chunks.values())

# Result:
# Cluster 0 (AI): ["AI transforms healthcare.", "ML diagnoses diseases."]
# Cluster 1 (Finance): ["Stock market crashed.", "Investors panicking."]
```

> **Trade-off:** Clustering reorders content - may not preserve narrative flow!

---

#### Edge Case 2: Similar Sentences Exceed Chunk Size

**The Problem:**
```
Sentences 1-20: All about "How to reset your password" (same topic)
Each sentence: ~50 tokens
Total: 1000 tokens

But your chunk_size limit is 500 tokens!
```

**What Basic Semantic Chunking Does:**
```
Compare 1→2: sim=0.95 → keep together
Compare 2→3: sim=0.93 → keep together
Compare 3→4: sim=0.91 → keep together
... (all high similarity - same topic!)
Compare 19→20: sim=0.94 → keep together

Result: ONE chunk of 1000 tokens! 😱
Exceeds your 500 token limit!
```

**Solution: Semantic + Size Limit (Production Approach)**
```python
def semantic_chunking_with_size_limit(text, max_tokens=500, threshold=0.7):
    sentences = split_into_sentences(text)
    embeddings = [get_embedding(s) for s in sentences]
    
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = [sentences[0]]
    current_tokens = count_tokens(sentences[0])
    
    for i in range(1, len(sentences)):
        sentence_tokens = count_tokens(sentences[i])
        similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[i-1], embeddings[i])
        
        # Check BOTH conditions
        would_exceed_limit = (current_tokens + sentence_tokens) > max_tokens
        topic_changed = similarity < threshold
        
        if would_exceed_limit or topic_changed:
            # Start new chunk (either too big OR topic changed)
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sentences[i]]
            current_tokens = sentence_tokens
        else:
            # Keep adding
            current_chunk.append(sentences[i])
            current_tokens += sentence_tokens
    
    chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
    return chunks
```

**Result with Size Limit:**
```
Chunk 1: Sentences 1-10 (500 tokens) - password reset part 1
Chunk 2: Sentences 11-20 (500 tokens) - password reset part 2
         ↑ Split due to SIZE, not topic change (both still about password reset)
```

**LangChain's SemanticChunker Handles This:**
```python
from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker

semantic_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    breakpoint_threshold_type="percentile",
    breakpoint_threshold_amount=95,
    # These parameters handle size limits:
    min_chunk_size=100,   # Don't create tiny chunks
    max_chunk_size=500,   # Force split if too large
)
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Key Insight:** Production semantic chunking is actually **semantic + size-aware**. Pure semantic chunking without size limits is rarely used in practice!

### Strategy 3: Recursive Chunking

**What It Is:** Split hierarchically using multiple separators, only splitting further if chunks are still too large.

**The Algorithm (from slide):**
```
Document ──► Segment by paragraphs/sections
                    │
                    ▼
              Select a segment
                    │
                    ▼
         ┌─────────────────────┐
         │ Size > chunk limit? │
         └─────────┬───────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────┴──────────┐
        │                     │
        NO                   YES
        │                     │
        ▼                     ▼
   Keep as-is          Split further recursively
   (final chunk)       (try next separator)
```

**How It Works:**
```python
# Try separators in order, from most to least specific
separators = [
    "\n\n",     # 1. Try paragraph breaks first
    "\n",       # 2. Then line breaks
    ". ",       # 3. Then sentence endings
    " ",        # 4. Then word boundaries
    ""          # 5. Last resort: character by character
]

# Only split more if chunk is still too large
if len(chunk) > max_size:
    try_next_separator()
```

```

**Code Example:**
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""],
    length_function=len
)
chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Preserves natural boundaries | May still break complex structures |
| Works well for most content | Requires tuning for specific formats |
| Best general-purpose choice | Not semantic-aware |
| Respects paragraph/sentence structure | |

**Best For:**
- **General purpose (DEFAULT CHOICE)**
- Articles, documentation, books
- Email threads, support tickets

> **Teaching Point:** "When in doubt, use recursive chunking - it's the Swiss Army knife of chunking strategies!"

### Strategy 4: Document Structure-Based Chunking

**What It Is:** Use the inherent structure of documents (headings, sections, paragraphs) to define chunk boundaries.

**Visual (from slide):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Document                                                                     │
│ ├── Title ──────────────────────► Chunk 1                                   │
│ ├── Introduction ───────────────► Chunk 2                                   │
│ ├── Section #1 ─────────────────► Chunk 3                                   │
│ ├── Section #2 ─────────────────► Chunk 4                                   │
│ └── Conclusion ─────────────────► Chunk 5                                   │
│                                                                              │
│              *Merge with recursive chunking if sections too large            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Output (from slide):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────┐

│ efficient learning environments and improved student outcomes.   │         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

**For Markdown Documents:**
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter

markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=[
        ("#", "Header 1"),
        ("##", "Header 2"),
        ("###", "Header 3"),
    ],
    strip_headers=False  # Keep headers in output
)
chunks = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_doc)

# Each chunk now has metadata!
# chunk.metadata = {"Header 1": "Main Title", "Header 2": "Subsection"}
```

**For HTML Documents:**
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import HTMLHeaderTextSplitter

html_splitter = HTMLHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=[
        ("h1", "Header 1"),
        ("h2", "Header 2"),
        ("h3", "Header 3"),
    ]
)
chunks = html_splitter.split_text(html_doc)
```

**For Code:**
```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, Language

python_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language(
    language=Language.PYTHON,
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50
)
# Splits by function/class definitions instead of arbitrary boundaries
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Preserves hierarchical context | Requires format-specific logic |
| Maintains metadata (headers become metadata) | May create very large or small chunks |
| Works great for structured docs | Can't handle unstructured text |
| Enables section-level filtering | |

**Best For:**
- Documentation (technical docs, wikis, manuals)
- Knowledge bases with clear structure
- Code repositories
- Any content with headers/sections

---

### Strategy 5: LLM-Based Chunking

**What It Is:** Use an LLM to intelligently create semantically isolated and meaningful chunks.

**Visual (from slide):**
```
Document ──► Input to LLM ──► LLM generates chunks ──► Final chunks
                   │
                   ▼
            "Please split this document into
             semantically coherent sections..."
```

**The Idea:**
- Every heuristic approach has upsides and downsides
- LLMs understand context and meaning beyond simple rules
- Let the LLM decide where the natural breakpoints are!

**Code Example:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def llm_chunking(document: str, target_chunks: int = 5) -> list:
    """Use an LLM to intelligently chunk a document."""
    
    prompt = f"""Divide the following document into {target_chunks} semantically 
coherent sections. Each section should:
1. Cover a single topic or theme
2. Be self-contained and understandable on its own
3. Have a natural beginning and end

Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, where each string is one chunk.

Document:
{document}

JSON array of chunks:"""
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0
    )
    
    import json
    chunks = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    return chunks
```

**Advanced Approach - Propositions:**
```python
def proposition_chunking(document: str) -> list:
    """Convert document to atomic propositions then group."""
    
    prompt = """Convert this document into a list of simple, atomic facts.
Each proposition should:
1. Be a single, complete statement
2. Be understandable without context
3. Include all necessary entity names (no pronouns)

Document: {document}

Return as JSON array of propositions:"""
    
    # First: Extract propositions
    propositions = llm_extract_propositions(document)
    
    # Then: Group related propositions into chunks
    chunks = group_similar_propositions(propositions)
    
    return chunks
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Highest semantic accuracy | **Expensive** (LLM calls for each doc!) |
| Understands context beyond heuristics | Slow processing |
| Can handle any document format | Non-deterministic (may vary) |
| Produces human-quality chunks | Rate limits become a concern |

**Best For:**
- High-value, complex documents
- When accuracy is critical and cost is acceptable
- Legal, medical, or research documents
- Small document sets

**Cost Consideration:**
```
100 documents × 2000 tokens each = 200,000 tokens
GPT-4 cost: ~$6-12 per chunking run
vs. Recursive: ~$0 (no LLM needed)
```

> **Teaching Point:** "LLM chunking is the nuclear option - use when nothing else works and you have the budget!"

---

## 4. Chunk Parameters Deep Dive

### Chunk Size Guidelines

| Size (tokens) | Character Approx | Use Case | Trade-off |
|---------------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| 100-200 | 400-800 | Precise Q&A | Fast but loses context |
| 200-500 | 800-2000 | **General RAG (default)** | Balanced |
| 500-1000 | 2000-4000 | Long-form answers | Complete but less precise |
| 1000+ | 4000+ | Summarization | Full docs but slow/expensive |

### Why OVERLAP Matters

```
Without Overlap:
─────────────────┼─────────────────
    Chunk 1      │     Chunk 2
"...password is  │ valid for 24..."
─────────────────┼─────────────────
                 ↑
        Information SPLIT!
        Query "password valid for" won't match!


With Overlap:
─────────────────────┐
    Chunk 1          │
"...password is valid│for 24 hours..."
─────────────────────┘
              ┌─────────────────────
              │     Chunk 2
"...is valid for 24 hours. After..."
              └─────────────────────
                     ↑
        Overlap captures boundary info!
        Query "password valid for" matches BOTH!
```

**Overlap Recommendations:**
| Use Case | Overlap % | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| General | 10-15% | chunk=500, overlap=50-75 |
| High-precision | 20-25% | chunk=500, overlap=100-125 |
| Cost-sensitive | 5-10% | chunk=500, overlap=25-50 |

## 6. Choosing the Right Strategy

### Decision Matrix

| Content Type | Recommended Strategy | Chunk Size | Why |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|-----|
| **Support tickets** | Fixed or Recursive | 200-400 | Short, already focused |
| **Documentation** | Structure-based | 400-600 | Has clear sections |
| **Blog posts/articles** | Recursive | 300-500 | Natural paragraphs |
| **Research papers** | Semantic | 400-800 | Topic-focused sections |
| **Code** | Language-aware | 200-400 | Function boundaries |
| **Legal/contracts** | LLM-based or Semantic | 500-800 | High accuracy needed |
| **Chat logs** | Fixed | 200-400 | No natural structure |

### Quick Decision Flow

```
START
  │
  ▼
Is document structured (headers, sections)?
  ├── YES → Use Structure-based chunking
  │
  └── NO
       │
       ▼
  Do you need highest semantic quality?
       ├── YES → Is cost acceptable?
       │           ├── YES → Use LLM-based
       │           └── NO → Use Semantic chunking
       │
       └── NO → Use Recursive chunking (default)
```

## 7. Demo Walkthrough

### Demo Overview (`demo.py`)

The demo shows:
1. Different chunking strategies on support ticket data
2. Building a Chroma vector store
3. Comparing retrieval quality across strategies
4. Metadata filtering

---

### Key Code Points to Highlight

**Strategy Comparison:**
```python
# Fixed-size: Simple but may break mid-sentence
fixed_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=20)

# Recursive: Smarter, tries natural boundaries
recursive_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=300,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " "]
)

# Structure-aware: For markdown/HTML
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(...)
```

**Building Vector Stores with Chroma:**
```python
# High-level: LangChain + Chroma (handles everything!)
chroma_store = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents, 
    embedding=embeddings_model,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"  # Optional: persist to disk
)

# Search returns Document objects with metadata
results = chroma_store.similarity_search(query, k=3)
```

**Metadata Filtering (key feature!):**
```python
# Search only authentication tickets
results = chroma_store.similarity_search(
    query,
    filter={"category": "Authentication"}
)

# Search only high priority
results = chroma_store.similarity_search(
    query,
    filter={"priority": "High"}
)
```

## 8. Common Mistakes to Warn About

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Counting by characters | Token limits are in TOKENS not chars | Use tiktoken to count |
| No overlap | Loses boundary information | Always use 10-20% overlap |
| Same size for all content | Different docs need different sizes | Tune per content type |
| Ignoring structure | Breaks headers, lists, code blocks | Use structure-aware splitters |
| Over-chunking short docs | Creates noise | Don't chunk if doc < target size |

---

## 9. Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with Recursive** - It's the best default choice
2. **Use tokens, not characters** - API limits are token-based
3. **Always include overlap** - 10-20% prevents information loss
4. **Match strategy to content** - Structured docs → structure-aware
5. **Test with real queries** - Validate retrieval quality
6. **Preserve metadata** - Enables filtering later
7. **Consider chunk + parent** - Small for search, large for context

---

## 10. Key Takeaways (Summary Slide)

1. **Chunking is CRITICAL** for RAG quality - bad chunks = bad retrieval
2. **5 Strategies:** Fixed, Semantic, Recursive, Structure-based, LLM-based
3. **Overlap** prevents information loss at boundaries
4. **Recursive chunking** is the best default for most cases
5. **Match strategy to content type** - structured docs need structure-aware
6. **Trade-offs exist:** Accuracy ↔ Cost ↔ Speed
